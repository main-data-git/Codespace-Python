the ###### trudged slowly up the dusty hill, its ears twitching at every sound. beside the ######, a farmer carried a small sack of grain, talking to the ###### as if it were an old friend. the ###### didn’t mind the chatter; it was used to the farmer’s stories about the other ######s in the village. at the top of the hill, the ###### stopped to rest, looking out over the fields where more ######s grazed peacefully. for such a humble ######, life was simple—walk, work, and occasionally, get a well-earned pat on the back.
